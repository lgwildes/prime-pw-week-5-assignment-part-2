      <li>Were we supposed to show we did the Codecademy HTML & CSS work from this week?</li>
      <li>When I pull the git status in Terminal for this and the previous assignment it not only shows the assignment as modified, but also says ".DS_Store" has been modified. I don't remember seeing that before and am curious where that is located and what it means.</li>
